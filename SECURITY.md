## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities please send me an email to fabius1705@live.de.

Please descripe the vulnerability as detailed as you can. And leave a description on how to recreate if possible. I will look up the mail when I have time next. It could be that I have further questions, so to ensure that I can understand the issue you can leave me a contact possability (like a email address). As this is only a hobby project I cannot savely secure that I can update this security issue, but I try my very best. If I accept the vulnerability I am on the way to fix it.

If I decline the vulnerability I may not have enough time to fix it or will not fix it.

In every case I am very happy of helping hands. So you are allowed to make pull requests where you fixed or start to fix these issues and I will if they are enhancments commit them.
