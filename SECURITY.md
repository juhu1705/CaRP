## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities please draft a net security advisory in this repository.

Please descripe the vulnerability as detailed as you can. And leave a description on how to recreate if possible. I will look up the issue when I have time next. It could be that I have further questions, so to ensure to look for a response at least one time a month (better one time a week). As this is only a hobby project I cannot savely secure that I can update this security issue fast, but I try my very best.

If I accept the vulnerability I am on the way to fix it.

If I decline the vulnerability I may not have enough time to fix it or will not fix it.

In every case I am very happy of helping hands. So you are allowed to make pull requests where you fixed or start to fix these security issues and I will if they are enhancements commit them. Please in that case first create a security advisory with a note that you are on the way to fix it, so I know what is going on.

Thanks for your help.
